}
\description{
Converts the list-style-tree to a data frame, where each
variety has an id value and references its' parent's id
value. ID value ranges correspond to generation. It is
possible that with more complex trees the range of id
values may need to expand to reduce the probability of two
varieties being assigned the same id value.
